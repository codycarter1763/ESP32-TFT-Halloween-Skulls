<h1>About</h1>
<h6> &emsp; This is a guide and build log of how to implement animated eyes into a halloween skull using the ESP32 microcontroller and two 1.44" SPI TFT screens. This is a fairly easy project, though it does take some TFT_eSPI library configuration to optimize the ESP32 and the 1.44" SPI TFT hardware.</h6>
